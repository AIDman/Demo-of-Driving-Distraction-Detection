# Demo-of-Driver-s-Distraction-Detection

A demo program of detecting whether a driver is focused on driving using one-class SVM & two-class SVM

## Module 1: Data Sender

### functions of the module:

Choose which driver(subject) to detect

Choose the type of SVM (one-class SVM or two-class SVM)

Train & save model with the driver's EEG data (with the chosen type of SVM)

Send the driver's EEG data to Data Analyzer in real-time

## Module2: Data Analyzer

### functions of the module:

Receive EEG data of the driver from Data Sender

Judge the driver's status using the trained model

Display the driver's status and EEG data in real time

## Document

You can get access to the details of the program in the document named 'Document for Demo Program.pdf'.
